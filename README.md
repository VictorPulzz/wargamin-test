# Test tasks from wargaming


## Both tasks are done!

1 - The first task was implemented in 2 ways using css background-image
and with svg

2 - The second task is made taking into account the resizing of both the window and the container


A hook was used to catch the resize of the component for code simplicity : use-resize-observer
